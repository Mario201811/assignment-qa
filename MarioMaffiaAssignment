Introduction

Based on the given assignment, where some coding is also asked, I just specify the QA Engineer specific role setting the Test Strategy proposed and tests cases, as I do not have enough knowledge for the used technical language programming.

Test Strategy
The approach used defines the required checks to verify the systems and applications concerned are up and running:
1. System Availability
2. Application is accessible
3. Prepare tests cases according to User Stories specifications
4. Prepare Test data
5. Regression tests after each delivery.

Test Cases
For this application 7 test cases are required based on 7 User Stories.
Completed User Stories:
	US01 Display the current date
	US02 View the list of pets
	US03 - Be able to add a new pet
	US04 - Be able to modify an existing pet
	US05 - Exposing a REST API
In progress:
	US06 Delete a single pet
In the backlog:
	US07 Delete multiple pets
